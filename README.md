# review-flashcard-app

#Kia ora, Welcome to my personal project - review.

#This personal project (that is still ongoing) is initially intended for studying as its main features are flashcards. However, i would like to develop this app more so that it can eventually end up as an app intended for personal use too. So that you can not only use it to study - but you can use it to learn more about friends!

#Current features that are working in the app are:
#Flashcard flipping
#2 routes

#Current features that need improvement
#User input
#CSS
#Media queries
#Routes
